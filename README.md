Deploying a big data analysis solution using IBM Cloud Databases and performing data analysis involves several steps as follows :

Deployment using IBM Cloud Databases:

1. IBM Cloud Account: Ensure you have an IBM Cloud account. If not, sign up at [IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/).

2. Create a Database:
   - Log in to your IBM Cloud account.
   - Go to the IBM Cloud Databases service.
   - Create a new database instance, choosing the database type that suits your needs (e.g., Db2, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.).
   - Configure the instance with the required resources and settings.

3. Database Connection:
   - Once the database instance is created, note the connection details such as the host, port, username, and password.

4. Deploy Your Solution:
   - You need to have your big data analysis solution ready for deployment. This could be an application, script, or data analysis tool.
   - Configure your solution to connect to the IBM Cloud Database using the connection details obtained in the previous step.

5. Testing: Test the connection and functionality of your solution to ensure it can interact with the IBM Cloud Database.

Performing Data Analysis:

Once your solution is deployed and connected to the IBM Cloud Database, you can start performing data analysis. Here are some general steps:

1. Data Import:
   - If your solution involves analyzing data, import your data into the IBM Cloud Database. You may use SQL or specific tools provided by the database service for this.

2. Query and Analysis:
   - Use SQL queries or data analysis toos to perform the desired analysis on the data stored in the database. You can use various data analysis libraries and frameworks if you are working with big data.

3. Visualization:
   - Visualize the results of your analysis using data visualization tools or libraries. Create charts, graphs, or reports to make the findings more understandable.

4. Iterate and Refine:
   - Analyze the results and refine your analysis as needed. You may need to modify your queries or analysis methods based on the initial results.

5. Export or Share Results:
   - Depending on your project's requirements, you can export the results, generate reports, or share the insights with your team or stakeholders.

Remember to secure your database and the analysis process to protect sensitive data. This can include implementing authentication, authorization, and encryption measures.

The specific steps for deploying your solution and performing data analysis may vary based on the technology stack and tools you are using. Be sure to consult the documentation and resources provided by IBM Cloud Databases and the tools you've chosen for data analysis to get detailed instructions specific to your setup.
